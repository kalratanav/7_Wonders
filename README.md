# 7_Wonders
**Java Edition**

## Introduction
This is a Java Graphical Implementation of the board game Seven Wonders. A few months of time have gone by in the creation of this game, and the final product is, well, relatively stable I suppose. This version of the game is the standalone edition without any expansion packs.

## Rules
The rules are a bit long, but I have linked two YouTube videos that will provide a guide on how to play the game.
